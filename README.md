# Tiptap 2 WYSIWYG editor for Voyager II

This is a WYSIWYG editor based on [tiptap 2](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap)

## TODO

- Add anchor extension
- Add image extension
- Add media-picker modal
- Add autocomplete based on a custom route (allow linking as well?)
- Add `input` class to ListItem checkbox when tiptap supports it
- Disabled should really be `disabled`. Tiptap only restricts writing into the editor (not running actions)
- Let user resize the editor in height
- Changing max character count after initializing does not work
